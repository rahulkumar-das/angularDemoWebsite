# AngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
It is possible that there may be some issue on GET call based on browser CORS policy. The website runs properly on localhost. I'll suggest clone the repository and add more features to it. It is my first try on Angular framework.
See the live demo [https://rahulkumar-das.github.io/angularDemoWebsite/]

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
